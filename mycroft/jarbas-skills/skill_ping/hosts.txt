# Enter a server per line in this format:
# lowercase keyword, 1 or 0 for server status or ping respectively, full URL
# Hence, given:
#     google, 0, https://google.com
# "Ping google" will return the ping time of https://google.com.
# Given
#     linux, 1, https://www.linux.com
# "Ping Linux" will return the server status for https://www.linux.com

# Note: When using the server status feature, a badly formed URL will
# often be rerouted to your internet provider's search, and will hence
# return the status of that server, usually `OK`. So double check your URLs.
